# **Deep Learning in Computational Photography - CPSC 8810**

**Course Overview:**

CPSC 8810: Deep Learning in Computational Photography is an advanced graduate-level course at Clemson University. This course explores the application of deep learning (DL) techniques to various aspects of computational photography. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including depth from single images, image super-resolution, and image style transfer. The course emphasizes practical implementation, primarily utilizing the PyTorch deep learning framework. 

During the semester, we were required to complete two projects. The first project focused on **rendering techniques** and provided hands-on experience in implementing rendering algorithms using PyTorch. 

## **Final Project Focus: Depth Estimation**

This project investigates **depth estimation from single images** using deep learning methods. 

**1. Project Overview**

* **Motivation:** Accurate depth perception is crucial for various applications, including robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. Traditional methods often rely on expensive and bulky hardware. This project aims to leverage the power of deep learning to achieve robust and cost-effective depth estimation from single images.

**2. Methodology**

* **Model Architecture:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, such as MiDaS, will be employed for depth estimation. 
* **Datasets:** The project will utilize a combination of datasets, including:
    * **NYU Depth Dataset V2:** Focuses on indoor environments.
    * **Make3D (Compact Dataset):** A lightweight dataset specifically designed for monocular depth estimation. 
* **Evaluation:** Model performance will be assessed using standard metrics such as:
    * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
    * **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**

**3. Key Deliverables**

* **Implementation:** A well-documented Python implementation of the chosen depth estimation model using PyTorch.
* **Training and Evaluation:** Trained models on the selected datasets and evaluated their performance using the specified metrics.
* **Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the project's methodology, results, and analysis.

This project provides a practical understanding of deep learning techniques for a critical task in computer vision and demonstrates their potential for real-world applications.
